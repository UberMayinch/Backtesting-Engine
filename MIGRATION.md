# Migration to uv - Summary of Changes

This document summarizes the changes made to migrate the Backtesting Engine project from traditional pip/venv to uv for virtual environment and dependency management.

## Files Added

### 1. `pyproject.toml`
- Modern Python project configuration file
- Defines project metadata, dependencies, and build system
- Includes development dependencies and tool configurations
- Replaces setup.py/requirements.txt for modern Python projects

### 2. `.python-version`
- Specifies Python version (3.10) for uv to use
- Ensures consistent Python version across environments

### 3. `Makefile`
- Convenient development commands using uv
- Commands for testing, linting, formatting, building
- Easy dependency management commands
- Replaces manual uv command memorization

### 4. `.gitignore`
- Updated for uv-specific files and patterns
- Excludes uv cache, lock files, and build artifacts
- Includes common Python and IDE patterns

## Files Modified

### 1. `README.md`
- Updated installation instructions to use uv
- Added comprehensive development setup guide
- Updated demo running instructions
- Added migration guide from pip/venv
- Enhanced project structure documentation
- Added uv benefits and usage patterns

### 2. `requirements.txt` (Kept for compatibility)
- Maintained for users who prefer pip
- Will be used as fallback option
- Dependencies now managed primarily through pyproject.toml

## Key Benefits of Migration

### Performance
- **10-100x faster** dependency resolution
- **Parallel downloads** and installations  
- **Cached dependencies** for repeated installs

### Developer Experience
- **Single command** setup: `uv sync`
- **Integrated tooling** with project management
- **Modern workflow** with `uv run` commands
- **Automatic virtual environment** management

### Project Management
- **Lock file** for reproducible builds
- **Development dependencies** separation
- **Tool configuration** in single pyproject.toml
- **Modern Python packaging** standards

### Security & Reliability
- **Dependency verification** and security checks
- **Consistent environments** across machines
- **Isolated project dependencies**

## Usage Patterns

### Old Workflow (pip + venv)
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
python demo.py
deactivate
```

### New Workflow (uv)
```bash
uv sync
uv run demo.py
```

### Development Commands
```bash
make install    # Install dependencies
make dev        # Install with dev dependencies  
make demo       # Run demo
make test       # Run tests
make lint       # Run linting
make format     # Format code
make help       # Show all commands
```

## Migration Path for Users

1. **Install uv**: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
2. **Remove old venv**: `rm -rf .venv/` (optional)
3. **Sync dependencies**: `uv sync`
4. **Start using**: `uv run demo.py`

## Backward Compatibility

- `requirements.txt` is maintained for pip users
- All existing Python code works unchanged
- Documentation includes both uv and pip instructions
- No breaking changes to the API or functionality

## Future Considerations

- Consider removing requirements.txt after full uv adoption
- Add GitHub Actions CI/CD using uv
- Explore uv's publishing and packaging features
- Consider using uv's script running for automation
